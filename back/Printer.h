	float ExtrudeRatio;	//If you are using the 4D firmware in the Arduino, this decides how much extrudate actually to lay down for a given movement. Thus if you set this to 0.7 and the head moves 100mm, then 70mm of extrudate will be deposited in that move. You can use this to control how fat or thin the extrudate trail is, though the machine should be set up so that this factor is 1.0.
	float ExtrusionBroadWidth;//The gap between the infill zig-zag pattern used to fill the interior of an object when coarse infill is being used. Set this negative to suppress coarse infill.
	float ExtrusionDelayForLayer;//For the first use of the extruder in a layer the time delay between turning on the extruder motor and starting to move the extruder to lay down material. See also ValveDelayForLayer (below).
	float ExtrusionDelayForPolygon;//For the second and all subsequent use of the extruder in a layer the time delay between turning on the extruder motor and starting to move the extruder to lay down material. See also ValveDelayForPolygon (below).
	float ExtrusionFoundationWidth;//The gap between the infill zig-zag pattern used to fill the interior of the foundations (if any).
	float ExtrusionHeight;//The depth of each layer. This value should be the same for all extruders in the machine at any one time.
	float ExtrusionInfillWidth;//The gap between the infill zig-zag pattern used to fill the interior of an object when fine infill is being used.
	float ExtrusionLastFoundationWidth;//The gap between the infill zig-zag pattern used to fill the interior of the last layer of the foundations (if any).
	float ExtrusionOverRun;//The distance before the end of a sequence of infill or outline depositions to turn off the extruder motor. See also ValveOverRun (below). Set this negative to keep running to the end.
	float ExtrusionSize;//The width of the filament laid down by the extruder.
	float ExtrusionSpeed;// On the latest extruders (see here) this sets the rate at which the extrudate exits the nozzle in millimeters per minute when the extruder is running in thin air (i.e. not building, or running the delay at the start of a layer or polygon - see above).
						 // Legacy. On earlier extruders it sets the PWM signal to send the extruder motor, as a fraction of 255. See also Extruder0_t0 (below).
						 // In either case, if there is no motor in use, set this negative.
	float ExtrusionTemp; //The temperature to run the extruder at.
	float FastXYFeedrate;//The fastest that this extruder can plot. This is the speed that the system will accelerate writing up to when accelerations are enabled. The system takes the minimum of this vale and the equivalent value for the machine overall when extruding.
	float Reverse;		 // The time to reverse the extruder motor when it is turned off, drawing the extrudate back into it and reducing dribble. 
	float UpperFineLayers;//Give this many layers at the top of the object fine infill.
