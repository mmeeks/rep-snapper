* openSUSE build service ... [!?]

GCode:
	Printer Temperature:
		+ No toggle-able for this; why not - [ 235 ]
		+ this is the 'M104'
			+ why are we using M104 - should use:
			+ M109 - set temp & wait for it ...
		+ why not move to the purge location ?

	Raft layers:
		+ bad news - look buggy ...


	GCode:
		+ add mimimal comments: 'new layer'
		+ 'start outline %d', 'start in-fill'
		+ Why bother with all this 'F2300' -everywhere-
		  on each command ?
			+ it is not changing, so ... why bother ?
		+ Why F70 and not F5 during the G1 Z command ?


	Reversing extruder:
		+ we *need* a G92 E0 between each layuer [!]
		+ but not each foundation layer ?

	Temperature Ratio:
		+ does it work ? why set to 1.90 ? [ most odd ! ]
		+ no M codes generated to change the raft temperature [!]



Using it to generage gcode:
	JGlauche: not
	EbiDK: not
	Rickta59 is ...
	Logick: is ...	


Search for USB ttys on Linux ... :-)


/* 

Default to:
	* Incremental E-code
	* Remove G92 E0 from 'next layer'

* Sizing / get side panel working [!?]

* Read / grok gcode
	+ work out why extrusion is different / odd ...

[ Rafts dont work: ]

Don't reverse at top speed for ages & break my extruder

Have a 'calculate steps_per_mm' for geared extruders etc.

* Fltk / gtk ...

* Threading:
	+ we should use the:
		Fl::awake() method to throw stuff to the mainloop ...


* Queue up patches removing affl headers - un-needed ... clean that up

* Queue up file-chooser pieces ...


** sooo ! ...
	+ it seems the movements are all clocked off the extruder:
		+ there is a mm/minute metric there ...
	+ Hence, 'E22.4' - will extrude 22.4 mm - as it moves A->B


  G1: Controlled move

Example: G1 X90.6 Y13.8 E22.4

Go in a straight line from the current (X, Y) point to the point (90.6, 13.8), extruding material as the move happens from the current extruded length to a length of 22.4 mm.

RepRap does subtle things with feedrates. Thus:

G1 F1500
G1 X90.6 Y13.8 E22.4

Will set a feedrate of 1500 mm/minute, then do the move described above at that feedrate. But

G1 F1500
G1 X90.6 Y13.8 E22.4 F3000

Will set a feedrate of 1500 mm/minute, then do the move described above accelerating to a feedrate of 3000 mm/minute as it does so. The extrusion will accelerate along with the X, Y movement so everything stays synchronized.

RepRap thus treats feedrate as simply another variable (like X, Y, Z, and E) to be linearly interpolated. This gives complete control over accelerations and decelerations in a way that ensures that everything moves together and the right volume of material is extruded at all points.

The first example shows how to get a constant-speed movement. The second how to accelerate or decelerate. Thus

G1 F1500
G1 X90.6 Y13.8 E22.4 F3000
G1 X80 Y20 E36 F1500

Will do the first movement accelerating as before, and the second decelerating from 3000 mm/minute back to 1500 mm/minute.

To reverse the extruder by a given amount (for example to reduce its internal pressure while it does an in-air movement so that it doesn't dribble) simply use G1 to send an E value that is less than the currently extruded length.
