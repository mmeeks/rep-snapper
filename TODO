Native Linux File selector integration

Makefile header dependencies are mandatory [URGH!]

Command-line file opening

Default to:
	* Incremental E-code
	* Remove G92 E0 from 'next layer'

* Sizing / get side panel working [!?]

* Read / grok gcode
	+ work out why extrusion is different / odd ...

Don't reverse at top speed for ages & break my extruder

Have a 'gears' and 'whatnot' conversion thingit (?)
